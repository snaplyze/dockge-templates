# Freeboard

Freeboard is a turn-key HTML-based 'engine' for dashboards. Besides a nice looking layout engine, it provides a plugin architecture for creating datasources (which fetch data) and widgets (which display data)— freeboard then does all the work to connect the two together.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd /opt/stacks/freeboard
docker compose up -d
```

## Ports

- `8000:80`: Service port
