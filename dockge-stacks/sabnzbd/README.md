# SABnzbd

SABnzbd makes Usenet as simple and streamlined as possible by automating everything we can. All you have to do is add an .nzb. SABnzbd takes over from there, where it will be automatically downloaded, verified, repaired, extracted and filed away with zero human interaction.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd /opt/stacks/sabnzbd
docker compose up -d
```

## Configuration

Edit `.env` file to customize your deployment:

- `PUID`: PUID
- `PGID`: PGID

## Ports

- `8080:8080`: Service port
- `9090:9090`: Service port

## Data Volumes

Your data is stored in:

- `./data/*`: Mapped to `/config` in container
- `./data/*`: Mapped to `/downloads` in container
- `./data/*`: Mapped to `/incomplete-downloads` in container
