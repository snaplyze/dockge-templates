# Adguard Home

AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads & tracking. After you set it up, it’ll cover ALL your home devices, and you don’t need any client-side software for that. With the rise of Internet-Of-Things and connected devices, it becomes more and more important to be able to control your network.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd /opt/stacks/adguardhome
docker compose up -d
```
